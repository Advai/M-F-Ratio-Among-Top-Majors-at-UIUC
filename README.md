# M-F-Ratio-Among-Top-Majors-at-UIUC
This project visualizes the Male to Female ratio of selected majors across ACES, Gies, LAS, and Engineering using slope graphs. Currently the visualization only works for the past 14 years. However, I am currently in the process of cleaning the data set further. I am also exploring the data set further for other interesting visualizations that I can make.
